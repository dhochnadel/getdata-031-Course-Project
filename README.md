To execute run_analysis.R, extract the UCI HAR Dataset found [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) to your R working directory.  You should have a folder named "UCI HAR Dataset" there which will have two folders named "train" and "test" (as well as four text files) within.

Then simply type run_analysis() in R (you will probably want to assign the output to a variable), the code will handle the rest.

This dataset was downloaded for use with run_analysis.R on 8/08/2015 at 2:55AM and was produced by:
